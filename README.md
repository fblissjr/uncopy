# UnCopy

Chrome extension that tries to removes tracking parameters from URLs. And if it doesn't, there's a manual button to do so.

## Install

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this directory

## Usage

**Two ways to use:**
1. **Automatic**: Links on web pages should (sometimes) be automatically cleaned when you visit them
2. **Manual**: Click the extension icon, paste a URL, and click "Clean URL"

**Example:**
- Before: `https://google.com/url?utm_source=share&rcm=tracking123`
- After: `https://google.com/url`
